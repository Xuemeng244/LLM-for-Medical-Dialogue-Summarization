You experienced a partial response per immune-related response criteria, which lasted 30 weeks before your disease progressed again.\nPatient: I remember that. But those medications were given to me again, right?\nDoctor: Correct. Ipilimumab and nivolumab were administered again, but they resulted in PD at 14 weeks. After that, we decided to try a different approach.\nPatient: That's when I started receiving avelumab and radiotherapy, right?\nDoctor: Yes, you were given avelumab (anti-PD-L1) 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks and 3D conformal radiation therapy, 2500 centigray, to a right iliac mass. This treatment resulted in a partial response (PR) per RECIST v1.1.\nPatient: I remember feeling better after that.\nDoctor: Indeed, there was marked regression in the irradiated tumor (Fig.), and your Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status improved from 2 to 0. Your partial response lasted 12 months.\nPatient: That's great to hear.

What brings you in today?\nPatient: Hi, I've been suffering from severe epigastric pain and nausea for the past two days.\nDoctor: I see. Based on your symptoms and your history, I would like to run some laboratory tests to see if there might be any issue with your pancreas. The findings may help us determine if you have pancreatitis or not.\nPatient: Okay, that makes sense.\n[After the tests]\nDoctor: Your laboratory findings were suspicious for pancreatitis, so we decided to proceed with a computed tomography (CT) examination. The CT scan showed an edematous pancreas tail and fluid in the anterior prerenal space as well as in the anterior, posterior, and lateroconal fascia. There were no signs of chronic pancreatitis or vascular complications, but you did have two similar episodes of acute tail pancreatitis in the following months.\nPatient: Oh, I see.\nDoctor: In September 2009, you presented with vague epigastric pain lasting several weeks. Your serum amylase and lipase levels were normal, but your cholestatic parameters were mildly elevated.

Can you describe the symptoms you've been experiencing?\nPatient: Yeah, my right leg has been really swollen and painful. It's been difficult to walk around.\nDoctor: I understand. So, before your surgical thrombectomy, you received a suprarenal IVC filter due to the short distance between the thrombus in the distal IVC and the inflow of renal veins.

How did you feel after the procedure?\nPatient: I felt a bit better, but still had some pain and swelling in my leg.\nDoctor: Hmm, I see. In a follow-up CT, we found that the filter had dislodged and tilted towards the right IVC wall with its legs piercing the contralateral wall and extending into the left renal vein. This was likely due to the surgical thrombectomy. You were given oral anticoagulation with Warfarin, but unfortunately, there was a re-thrombosis.

We conducted a magnetic resonance angiography of your left hand to get a better understanding of the mass, but its etiology is still unclear (Fig. ).\nPatient: Hmm, so what's the next step, then?\nDoctor: We performed an operative excision under general anesthesia to remove the mass. We made a longitudinally oriented ulnar-sided skin incision, dissected the palmar fascia, and released Guyon's canal. The mass was found to be arising from beneath the hypothenar musculature, and it appeared tan-white, rubbery, and lobulated (Fig. ).\nPatient: What did the pathology report say?\nDoctor: The pathology report confirmed that the mass is a benign myxoma (Fig. ). There were no postoperative complications, which is a good sign.\nPatient", "prediction": "Subjective: The patient, with a history of acute inflammatory demyelinating process, reports a mass on the left wrist and hypothenar area that has been increasing in size over the past three months. The mass has led to generalized weakness, ataxia, and loss of sensation in the affected areas. No previous trauma, previous surgeries, or other masses were reported.\nObjective : Physical examination revealed a soft, nontender mass, which does not limit the patient's range of motion. Gloved grip strength was noted as decreased compared to the other hand. Radiographs were normal. Magnetic resonance angiography was performed, identifying the mass as a lipoma. Postoperative pathology confirmed a benign myxoma with no postoperative complications.", "summarization": "Subjective: The patient, with a history of acute inflammatory demyelinating process, reported noticing a mass on the left wrist and hypothenar area about 3 months ago, which has been progressively causing discomfort. The patient also experiences generalized weakness, ataxia, and sensory deficits including a complete lack of sensation in the left small finger and the ulnar side of the hand, making it difficult to use the left hand.\nObjective: Physical examination revealed a soft, nontender mass in the left hand that does not limit range of motion but is associated with decreased grip strength. Radiographs of the left upper extremity were normal. Magnetic resonance angiography was performed but did not clarify the etiology of the mass. Operative excision under general anesthesia was conducted, and the pathology report confirmed the mass as a benign myxoma. Postoperative recovery showed marked improvement in numbness and weakness, with intact sensation in the ulnar nerve distribution and improved grip strength.\nAssessment: The primary diagnosis is a benign myxoma of the left hand, which was surgically excised. The sensory deficits and weakness were likely exacerbated by the mass but have shown significant improvement postoperatively. There is no evidence of recurrence or postoperative complications"}

The family reported the vehicle was traveling in excess of 79 miles per hour at the time of the accident. The patient was unconscious and not breathing independently upon arrival at the hospital. There was no known past medical or surgical history that could have contributed to the incident.\nObjective: Upon arrival, the patient was found to be unconscious with unsuccessful intubation attempted at the scene. Radiographs revealed internal decapitation with AO assimilation between the anterior arch of the atlas and the basiocciput. No fractures, including the odontoid process, were noted. The patient was pronounced dead shortly after arrival.\nAssessment: The primary diagnosis is internal decapitation due to a high-speed vehicle collision. The AO assimilation, previously unknown, did not contribute to the outcome but was noted on imaging. The severity of the collision was the primary factor leading to the fatal outcome.\nPlan: Given the patient's demise, the plan involves providing support and information to the family. The family will be offered grief counseling and any further assistance they might require during this difficult time. No further medical"}
