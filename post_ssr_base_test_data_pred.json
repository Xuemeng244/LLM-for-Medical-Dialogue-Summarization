It seems like you have developed severe acute pancreatitis. When you were admitted to the hospital, we started a continuous intravenous infusion of fentanyl at 1200 g/day to control your abdominal pain. Over the course of 10 days, we increased the dose according to your pain intensity, reaching 2400 g/day (MED 240 mg/day). How has your pain been since then? Patient: It's been a little bit better with the fentanyl, but it's still quite painful. Doctor: I see. In addition to the fentanyl, we have also administered a pancreatic enzyme inhibitor, antibiotic, and fluid to help alleviate the pancreatitis and your abdominal pain.

Let me take a closer look. Hmm, it appears to be an 8-millimeter flat, brown papule. Since we're uncertain about the lesion's initial presentation, pattern of growth, and appearance, I would recommend a shave removal of the lesion to examine it further. How does that sound? Patient: Okay, I guess that sounds fine. [After the shave removal and excision] Doctor: We have examined the original excision, and it showed an atypical intraepidermal melanocytic proliferation. The dermis also contained scattered foci of tattoo pigment and fibrosis. It's important to note that an early evolving melanoma in situ couldn't be excluded at that time.

Patient's Family: Yes, we remember. She passed away despite the treatment. Doctor: That's correct. After her passing, she was submitted to the National Zoological Gardens of South Africa for a necropsy examination. She was part of a project to re-establish cheetah populations in protected, fenced reserves. The goal was to ensure the animals were fit and able to hunt effectively before being released. Patient's Family: Yes, we know they went through a re-wilding process in a 1 ha enclosure initially. Doctor: Exactly. While in the enclosure, antelope and birds were shot on the reserve as cheetah food. Once the cheetahs were able to open and feed off a full carcass, they were released from the enclosure and monitored intensively. The management, handling, and feeding schedules were consistent among the female and three males. Unfortunately, the female was the only mortality. Patient's Family: That's so sad.

Patient: Yes, I've been tested for all of those, and the results came back negative. Doctor: Okay, that's good to know. Based on your symptoms of fever and headache, I'm considering a provisional diagnosis of meningoencephalitis. I'll order a CT brain scan with contrast to further investigate your condition. Patient: Alright, thank you. Doctor: The CT brain scan with contrast has shown multiple ring-enhancing lesions. We also performed an MRI brain spectroscopy, which revealed ring-enhancing lesions with surrounding oedema. These lesions are reported to be tuberculomas based on the imaging findings and MRI spectroscopy findings. Patient: Oh! What does that mean? Doctor: Tuberculomas are masses that can develop in the brain due to a tuberculosis infection. To further investigate, we performed a CT thorax scan with administration of intravenous contrast. The scan showed consolidation with cavitation in your left upper lobe and fibrosing mediastinitis. There was also soft tissue extension along the left hilum, narrowing the left pulmonary vessels and left bronchus. Enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes were seen as well. Patient: That sounds serious.

Can you tell me about your past medical history? Patient: Yes, two years ago, I had a left salpingo-oopherectomy for an ovarian mucinous adenocarcinoma. I received six cycles of combined chemotherapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel afterward and was advised to use contraception. I didn't follow up after that, and now I am pregnant. Doctor: Thank you for providing that information. Let's do an abdomen examination to check for any issues. *After examining the patient* It appears that there is some ascites and your uterus is about the size of a 24 weeks pregnancy with palpable fetal parts. We should also do an ultrasound examination to investigate further. Patient: Okay, what did you find in the ultrasound? Doctor: The ultrasound shows an intra-uterine pregnancy of 23 weeks and a right ovarian mass of 12.8 x 8.8 cm with solid and cystic areas containing free fluid with internal echoes. Your CA-125 level is also elevated at 80 IU/ml. Based on these findings, it seems like you have recurrent ovarian cancer during your pregnancy. Patient: Oh no, what are my options? Doctor: Ideally, we would recommend surgical management to address the cancer. However, I understand that you declined this option. Instead, we started you on two courses of chemotherapy with a single dose of carboplatin 450mg intravenously at three-week intervals. Patient: Yes, I remember that. But I couldn't do the third course because my liver function tests were not good. Doctor: That's correct. Unfortunately, the ascites has been progressive, which has led to maternal respiratory distress and fetal growth restriction and oligohydroamnios.

Can you describe the symptoms you've been experiencing? Patient: Yeah, my right leg has been really swollen and painful. It's been difficult to walk around. Doctor: I understand. So, before your surgical thrombectomy, you received a suprarenal IVC filter due to the short distance between the thrombus in the distal IVC and the inflow of renal veins. The surgical access was established via venotomy of the common femoral vein, and an occlusion balloon was used for the thrombectomy. How did you feel after the procedure? Patient: I felt a bit better, but still had some pain and swelling in my leg. Doctor: Hmm, I see. In a follow-up CT, we found that the filter had dislodged and tilted towards the right IVC wall with its legs piercing the contralateral wall and extending into the left renal vein. This was likely due to the surgical thrombectomy. You were given oral anticoagulation with Warfarin, but unfortunately, there was a re-thrombosis. We then performed catheter-directed thrombolysis, including stenting of the common iliac veins and the IVC. However, we didn't attempt filter retrieval at that time due to the large amount of clot within the filter. Patient: Oh, I see. So, what happened next? Doctor: After 5 weeks of Warfarin therapy, you were scheduled for a retrieval, which was considered mandatory due to the displaced and tilted filter with penetrating legs. We introduced a 14-F sheath, an SOS catheter, a Bentson wire, and an EN Snare to create a loop. We attempted the single loop-snare technique several times, but it kept slipping around the filter legs. Patient: That sounds difficult. What did you do then? Doctor: To stabilize the loop, we formed a second loop using the same technique around the filter tip.

{"document": "Doctor: Hi there, I heard you've been experiencing some wrist pain and unsightly appearance of your wrist after a previous fracture. Can you please describe how it feels and when these symptoms started to develop? Patient: Yeah, the pain is mostly on the ulnar side of my wrist, and it started about a year after the fracture. The appearance of my wrist seems a bit deformed too. Doctor: I see. Based on the physical examination and the tests we ran, it appears that you have a growth plate fracture in your right distal radius, specifically a SalterHarris type II fracture. You were initially treated with cast immobilization and closed reduction, which allowed the fracture to heal. However, the wrist pain and deformity you're experiencing now are due to a condition called partial physeal arrest. Patient: Oh, I see. What does that mean? Doctor: Partial physeal arrest occurs when the growth plate in your wrist is damaged, causing it to stop growing properly. In your case, radiographs showed a shortening deformity of the distal radius and an abnormal radial inclination of the articular surface. A CT scan was also performed to evaluate the deformity and for preoperative simulation with a low-radiation setting. Patient: So, what's the plan to fix this? Doctor: We have planned a two-stage operation for you. The first stage will involve a procedure called distraction osteogenesis to gradually lengthen the affected bone. The second stage will be the Langenskiöld procedure, which aims to remove the physeal bar and reestablish physeal growth. Patient: Will this help with the pain and appearance of my wrist? Doctor: Yes, the goal of the operation is to correct the deformities of the wrist and improve its appearance and function. In the first operation, we'll use a closed-wedge osteotomy to correct the distal radius, and an external fixator called the Orthofix MiniRail FixatorTM will be used for lengthening.

Can you tell me more about your situation? Patient: Hi, Doctor. I'm a 55-year-old divorced, multiparous Caucasian woman. My hallucinations started about four months ago. At first, I heard a young girl and a rodent in my house. Then I started experiencing visual and tactile hallucinations of scabies crawling out of my skin. Doctor: I see. And these hallucinations of scabies led you to believe that you had delusional parasitosis? Patient: Yes, that's right. It got so bad that I began picking at my skin and applying bleach, ammonium-based cleaning products, and scabicidal agents to try to get rid of them. I even have self-inflicted excoriation and burn injuries on my face, extremities, and abdomen because of it. Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. It must have been very distressing for you.

CT results show an inhomogeneous soft-tissue mass that occupies the right nasal cavity, maxillary sinuses and anterior and posterior ethmoidal cells. MRI results indicate nonspecific inflammation. Initial CT findings show inflammatory tissue, which includes pterygopalatine foses, erosion of posterior wall and entry into the orbital cavity. Preoperative diagnosis is not invasive characteristics. Clinical examination: Observation: A biopsy of paranasal sinus, with extensive bone remodeling of right sinus and proximal sinus. The musculospinal systosis, as well as an", "summarization": "Subjective: Patient with Crouzon syndrome presents with multiple episodes of epistaxis over the past few days and chronic nasal obstruction with impaired nasal breathing for several months. No other significant medical history reported. Objective: Clinical examination revealed a polypoid lesion protruding from the right nostril, facial asymmetry, and projection of the ipsilateral canine fossa. CT imaging showed an inhomogeneous soft-tissue mass occupying the right nasal cavity, maxillary sinus, and ethmoidal cells, with extensive bone remodeling and erosion but no invasive characteristics. Routine lab tests are within normal limits. Biopsy indicated nonspecific inflammation. Postoperative findings confirmed nasal polyposis with inflammation but no fungal invasion or macroscopic neighboring structure invasion. Assessment: Primary diagnosis of extensive nasal polyposis secondary to Crouzon syndrome, complicated by significant structural changes in the nasal cavity and surrounding areas. Differential diagnosis initially included possible malignant or invasive pathology, which was ruled out by imaging and histopathological examination. Plan: Surgical intervention was performed via lateral rhinotomy and medial maxillectomy, with complete removal"}
